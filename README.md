The game displays an ASCII art logo.

A random number between 1 and 100 is generated.

The player chooses a difficulty level:

Hard → 5 attempts

The player guesses a number.

After each guess:

The program tells the player if the guess is too high or too low.

The number of remaining attempts decreases.
